planting trees
training enemies
filling oceans
stocking the shop
gathering penguins
figuring out the meaning of life
wasting time
getting ready
yearning
burning bridges
lighting a candle
setting the mood
planting evidence
trimming fingernails
getting therapy
remembering
thinking
forgetting
consulting the manual
having a snack
counting every pixel
opening a can of worms
making sure everything smells right
