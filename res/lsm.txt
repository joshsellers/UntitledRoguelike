planting trees
training enemies
filling oceans
stocking the shop
gathering penguins
figuring out the meaning of life
wasting time
getting ready
yearning
burning bridges
lighting a candle
setting the mood
planting evidence
trimming fingernails
getting therapy
remembering
thinking
forgetting
consulting the manual
having a snack
counting every pixel
opening a can of worms
making sure everything smells right
cracking knuckles
releasing the hounds
peeling bananas
trying
studying geography
calculating fluid dynamics
checking the numbers
questioning my existence
attending meetings
downloading RAM
patching holes
generating stuff
finding love and affection
getting to work
wandering about
hurrying up
adding nonsense
adding salt
adding pepper
reducing
buying milk
heeding the warnings
turning the lights on
turning the lights off
justifying myself
alienating everyone
crunching numbers
folding clothes
doing laundry
